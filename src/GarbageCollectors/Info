1. Minor GC - it holds the young generation of the heap where new objects are created having null refernece.
it holds the objects which survived prev minor GC's.
minor garbage collections happens frequently.

2. major GC - happens not frequently, it can clean the old or long lived objects which have survived multiple minor GC's.

3. serial garbage collectors - it uses a single thread for both minor and major GC's.

 if there is a class name with MyApp.java, run the pgm using java -XX:+UseSerialGC MyApp.

4. parallel garbage collectors - it uses multiple threads for minor and major GC's.
java -XX:+UseParallelGC MyApp

5. G1 garbage first collectors (G1 GC)- it divides the heap into multiple regions.
aims for region having the most garbage first..
java -XX:+UseG1GC MyApp

6. Z garbage collectors (ZGC) -  it handles heap in terabytes, perform work concurrently.
java -XX:+UseZGC MyApp
