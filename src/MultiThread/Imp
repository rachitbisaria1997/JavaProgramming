By default, Spring Boot uses an embedded Tomcat server.

maxThreads = 200
That means 200 concurrent threads can handle incoming HTTP requests by default.

You can configure it in application.properties:
server.tomcat.max-threads=500


Normalization is the process of organizing database tables to:

✅ Eliminate data redundancy (duplicate data).

✅ Ensure data consistency and integrity.

✅ Divide large tables into smaller related tables.

Instead of storing customer + order + address in the same table, we separate into:

Customer Table (CustomerID, Name)

Address Table (AddressID, CustomerID, Address)

Order Table (OrderID, CustomerID, Product, Quantity)

advantages of Normalization:

Advantage	Why It’s Useful
No Data Redundancy	Saves storage and avoids duplicate data
Data Consistency	Update data in one place reflects everywhere
Better Data Integrity	Easier to enforce foreign key relationships
Easier Maintenance	Smaller, simpler tables

Q. What is Denormalization in DBMS?
Denormalization is the process of combining tables to reduce the number of joins and improve read performance, at the cost of
introducing some redundancy. Instead of keeping Customer and Address in separate tables, combine them into a single table:

Advantage	Why It’s Useful
Faster Reads	No need for multiple table joins during query
