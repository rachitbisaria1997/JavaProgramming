An Exception is an abnormal condition that occurs during the execution of a program.
Exceptions are recoverable (usually), and the program can handle them using try-catch blocks.

example:


    try{
        int result = 10 / 0;
    }
    catch(ArithmeticException e)
    {
        System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero!");
    }


An Error represents a serious problem that an application should not try to handle.
Examples: OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError. Errors are thrown by the JVM, not by application code.
Errors are unrecoverable in general.

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Causes StackOverflowError
        recursiveMethod();
    }

    public static void recursiveMethod() {
        recursiveMethod();
    }
}

------>>> Both Exception and Error extend the common parent class which is Throwable. It provides methods like

getMessage()

printStackTrace()

getCause()

Throable t = new Exception("this is throwable object");
SOP(t.getMessage()); - this is throwable object


1. checked exception - An exception that the compiler checks at compile-time.Trying to divide by zero,
null pointer access, file not found, etc.

2. unchecked exception - An exception that the compiler does NOT check at compile-time.

| Checked Exceptions       | Unchecked Exceptions             |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `IOException`            | `NullPointerException`           |
| `SQLException`           | `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` |
| `FileNotFoundException`  | `IllegalArgumentException`       |
| `ClassNotFoundException` | `ArithmeticException`            |
